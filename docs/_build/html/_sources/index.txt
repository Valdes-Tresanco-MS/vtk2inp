   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

dammit!
=======


dammit is a simple de novo transcriptome annotator. It was born out of the
observations that annotation is mundane and annoying, all the individual pieces
of the process exist already, and the existing solutions are overly complicated 
or rely on crappy non-free software.

Science shouldn't suck for the sake of sucking, so dammit attempts
to make this sucky part of the process suck a little less.

dammit is free and open source, and has been built around a free
and open source ecosystem. As such, programs which the author does not
consider free enough have been eschewed as dependencies. This can either mean
programs with nonfree licenses *or* programs which are overly difficult to install
and configure -- we believe that access is a part of openness.
