# Getting started
gmx_MMPBSA is a new tool aid to perform end-state free energy calculations based on AMBER's MMPBSA.py with GROMACS 
files.

Most of the documentation below is found in the [Amber manual][1], we will point out what is new or different. 
Neither of these should be considered as a “black-box”, and users should be familiar with Amber and MM/PB(GB)SA 
method before at-tempting these sorts of calculations. These scripts automate a series of calculations, and cannot 
trap all the types of errors that might occur. 

!!! important
    We do not intend to replace the original [MMPBSA.py][2]; instead, we have implemented and improved some 
    functionalities, and what is most important, made this valuable tool available for GROMACS users. Most of the 
    documentation below is found in the [Amber manual][1], we will point out what is new or different.
